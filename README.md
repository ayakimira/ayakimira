Some vibe coder whose only language stack she really knows boils down to a mix of HTML 4 and 5 lol

Currently playing with Android repos and trying to create apps like it's playing in a sandbox

### What's been tried so far:

*   **Bode**: A Discord Rich Presence manager (based on [Kizzy](//github.com/dead8309/Kizzy)) for Android written in Kotlin. It uses the Discord Gateway to allow users to customize their presence with app and media detection, supporting Material You and background execution.
*   **Boxidio**: A specialized video generation engine for Android that creates MP4 files **visualizing an audio player** from scratch using native APIs (`MediaCodec`, `OpenGL ES`, `MediaMuxer`). It handles audio transcoding and frame-by-frame rendering without external player dependencies.
*   **Override** (bow-reborn): A(n experimental and currently not fully working) reimagining of "Better Open With," acting as a custom replacement for the Android "Open with" dialog. It gives users fine-grained control over which apps handle specific file types and URLs.
*   **Cobalt**: A(n experimental and currently not fully working) native Android wrapper for `cobalt.tools`. It enhances the web-based media downloader with a native interface, injecting custom CSS/JS to optimize the UI for mobile and integrating with the Android `DownloadManager` for blob and URL downloads.
