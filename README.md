Some vibe coder whose only language stack she really knows boils down to a mix of HTML 4 and 5 lol

Currently playing with Android repos and trying to create apps like it's playing in a sandbox

### What's been tried so far:

*   **Bode**: A Discord Rich Presence manager for Android written in Kotlin. It uses the Discord Gateway to allow users to customize their presence with app and media detection, supporting Material You and background execution.
*   **Boxidio**: A specialized video generation engine for Android that creates MP4 files from scratch using native APIs (`MediaCodec`, `OpenGL ES`, `MediaMuxer`). It handles audio transcoding and frame-by-frame rendering without external player dependencies.
*   **Bow-reborn**: A reimagining of "Better Open With," acting as a custom replacement for the Android "Open with" dialog. It gives users fine-grained control over which apps handle specific file types and URLs.
*   **Cobalt**: A native Android wrapper for `cobalt.tools`. It enhances the web-based media downloader with a native interface, injecting custom CSS/JS to optimize the UI for mobile and integrating with the Android `DownloadManager` for blob and URL downloads.
